# Process & Design

## Before we start to build our website we should Make a plane about this website .

1.	### Who is the Site For

Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is Individuals or Companies
Invent some fictional visitors from your typical target audience. They will become your friends .They can influence design decisions from color palettes to level of detail in descriptions

2.	### Why People Visit YOUR Website

After you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason

3. ### What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve

It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs.

4. ### What Information Your Visitors Need

You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

5. ### How Often People Will Visit Your Site
Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static

6. ### Site Maps
Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages

7. ### WireFrames

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

8. ### Getting your message across using design

The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in.

9. ### Visual hierarchy

Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.

10. ### grouping and Similarity

When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. 

11. ### Designing Navigation

Site navigation not only helps people find where they want to go, but also helps them understand what your site is about and how it is organized. Good navigation tends to follow these principles.


# JavaScript

### JavaScript can be used in browsers to make  websites more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup  used in web page while it is being viwed in the browser,interesting,  and user-friendly.

* ACCESS CONTENT
 **You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page**
* MODIFY CONTENT
**You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them**
* PROGRAM RULES
**You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page**
* REACT TO EVENTS
**You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.**
## what is the Script?
### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal 
* MANUALS
* HANDBOOKS
* RECIPES

## To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

### Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.
* DEFINE THE GOAL
* DESIGN THE SCRIPT
* CODE EACH STEP

## expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE

## Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values
1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
**Assign a value to a variable example color = 'beige';**
2. COMPARISON OPERATORS
**Compare two values and return true or fa1se example buy = 3 > 5;**
3. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
**Perform basic math example area = 3 * 2;**
4. LOGICAL OPERATORS
**Combine expressions and return true or fa1se buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);**
5. STRING OPERATORS
**Combine two strings example greeting= 'Hi' + 'Molly';**

# What is the Funcations ??
## Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function.

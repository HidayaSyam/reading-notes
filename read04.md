# Controlling the Position of Elements
### positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning.
- Normal Flow
## The term normal flow refers to the normal behavior of the browser. As you've surely noticed, everything defaults to the left of the browser unless otherwise modified by HTML or CSS.
- Relative positioning
## Relative positioning changes the position of the HTML element relative to where it normally appears.
- absolute positioning
## is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).


# Funcation in JavaScript
## Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

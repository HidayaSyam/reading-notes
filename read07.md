# Defining an HTML Table
### A table represents information in a grid format. 
#### Examples of tables include 
- financial reports
- TV schedules
- sports results.
  
#### Each table row is defined with the <tr> tag. A table header is defined with the <th> tag. By default, table headings are bold and centered. A table data/cell is defined with the <td> tag.
  
 ## <th>
  
 #### The <th> element is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.)

### The colspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across.

  ## Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
  
  ## IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
### If a variable is part of an object, it is called a property. Properties te ll us about the object, such as the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has. Each individual hotel might have a different name and a different number of rooms

## IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME
### KNOWN AS METHODS If a function is part of an object, it is called a method. Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object. For example, you can check how many rooms are available by subtracting the number of booked rooms from the total number of rooms.

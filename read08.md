### Building Blocks
#### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.


|Type | effact | Example|
------|----------|---------|
|Block Level |start on a new line | li ,ul p, h1|
| Inline elements |flow in between surrounding text | img , b ,i|

### Containing Elements

#### If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

## Controll ing the Position of Elements
- Normal flow
   ## Every block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one. Even if you specify the width of the boxes and there is space for two elements to sit side-byside, they will not appear next to each other.
   
- Relative Positioning
   ## This moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed. This does not affect the position of surrounding elements; they stay in the position they would be in in normal flow.
- Absolute positioning
  ## This positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position of any surrounding elements (as they simply ignore the space it would have taken up).
  
## Layout Grids
### Grids set consistent proportions and spaces between items which helps to create a professional looking design

## CSS Frameworks
#### CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on.
